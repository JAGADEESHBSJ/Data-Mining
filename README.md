# Naive-Bayes
  
  Naive Bayesian classiﬁers assume that the effect of an attribute value on a given class is independent of the values of the other 
 attributes. This assumption is called classconditional independence. It is made to simplify the computations involved and, in this sense,
 is considered “ naive ” .
 
 	Modify the tuple in the main() function , in order to test the performance of the model .
